## 10/21/2025 - first prototype designs  

Made 2D designs in figma, tried to 3D model it in Fusion (but kinda flopped)![resim.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE0NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--22bb11e680e6ddcf22df42393f30b326ba5bde91/resim.png)
Prototype 3D design in Fusion (only base, still need to add other details): ![resim.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fcb1e1a9b04a4ee938c6f07694faa865c95a3ca3/resim.png)
