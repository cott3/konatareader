## 10/21/2025 - first prototype designs  

Made 2D designs in figma, tried to 3D model it in Fusion (but kinda flopped)![resim.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE0NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--22bb11e680e6ddcf22df42393f30b326ba5bde91/resim.png)
Prototype 3D design in Fusion (only base, still need to add other details): ![resim.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fcb1e1a9b04a4ee938c6f07694faa865c95a3ca3/resim.png)

  

## 10/22/2025 - more 3d designing  

a lot of time of my caveman brain trying to figure out how to use fusion
and after that, actually doing stuff!

now i have to find an eink display that can fit

  

## 10/23/2025 9 PM - a bit more 3d designing  

added these holes for potential magnets

what are these magnets for? you might ask
well, im planning on adding a stylus!
and these magnets will be for attaching said stylus, to the side of the reader
oh heres also a prototype design for the stylus

## 10/23/2025 10 PM - model update  

after struggling to find an eink display that fit the previous dimensions, (165mm h x 115mm w), i decided to just increase the height to 171mm and this is the result (tbh it looks cooler this way):

## 11/1/2025 - Initial UI design  

designed the UI prototypes for the main "My library" page, an apps list and a few more things
